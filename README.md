# Insurance Cost Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how age affects insurance charges using linear regression (specifically, simple linear regression) 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `insurance.csv`, which includes features such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region, and insurance charges.
The insurance_csv file has also been aploaded. 

## Objectives

- Analyze the relationship between age and insurance charges.
- Visualize the data using scatter plots.
- Fit a linear regression model using `sklearn` to predict insurance charges based on age.
- Plot the best-fit line over the original data to visualize the regression.

## Tasks or procedure

1. Create a Jupyter Notebook called `insurance_regression.ipynb`.
2. Select the approipriate kernel environment for the Jupiter Noatebook.
3. Import the dataset `insurance.csv` into your notebook.
4. Make sure that your dataset and Jupiter Notebook file are on the same folder before you import the dataset.
5. Preview the data using the 'insurance_data.head()' function to make dataset columns clear and make sense.
6. Use the `age` and `charges` columns to analyze the data: select these columns using the iloc[] function for plotting.
   - Plot a scatter plot with **age** on the x-axis and **charges** on the y-axis using matplotlib.
   - Create a Linear.Regression() model from sklearn and fit the model to the  data.
   - Predict charges based on age using the fitted model.
   - Plot the best-fit regression line on the scatter plot.

## Required programming language (PL), libraries (L) and interactive Environment (IE) :

- Python3.x - PL
- pandas - L
- matplotlib - L
- scikit-learn L
- Jupyter Notebook - IE

  ### Installing the above using pip:
  -Open the terminal or command prompt and run:
  pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn notebook

  ### This will install :
  - Pandas - for data handling,
  - matplotlib: for plotting,
  - Scikit-learn (sklearn) : for linear regression
  - and Notebook : which gives you access to Jupiter Notebook.
